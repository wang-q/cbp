`cbp` is a **C**ross-platform **B**inary **P**ackage manager that simplifies the distribution of CLI
tools, with a focus on bioinformatics software. It ensures compatibility with older Linux systems (
glibc 2.17+), Windows (x86_64), and provides native support for Apple Silicon, using Zig for
reliable cross-platform builds.

The name `cbp` draws inspiration from DNA's **c**onstant **b**ase **p**airing - nature's most
precise pairing system where A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. Similarly, `cbp` ensures consistent
binary compatibility across different platforms, making software distribution as reliable as DNA
replication.

## Features

* Cross-platform compatibility
    - Linux (glibc 2.17+)
    - macOS (Apple Silicon)
    - Windows (x86_64)
* Minimal dependencies
    - Only requires a terminal (Bash/PowerShell)
* Package management
    - Pre-built binaries without dependencies
    - GitHub release integration
    - Local package support
    - Customizable installation paths

## Quick Start

* Linux/macOS

```bash
# Install cbp
curl -LO https://github.com/wang-q/cbp/releases/latest/download/cbp.linux
chmod +x cbp.linux
./cbp.linux init
source ~/.bashrc

# List available packages
cbp avail

# Install packages
cbp install fd jq

# Manage packages
cbp list                 # list installed packages
cbp list fd              # show package contents
cbp remove fd            # remove package

```

* Windows

```powershell
# Install cbp
iwr "https://github.com/wang-q/cbp/releases/latest/download/cbp.windows.exe" -OutFile cbp.windows.exe
.\cbp.windows.exe init

# Restart terminal
# The rest is the same as Linux/macOS

```

> ⚠️ Windows WSL is Linux.

## FAQ

### Why use Zig for cross-compilation?

Zig provides a consistent cross-compilation experience across different platforms and targets
specific glibc versions, which is essential for compatibility with older Linux distributions like
CentOS 7.

### How does this compare to Conda/Bioconda?

While Conda provides a comprehensive package management system, this project focuses specifically
on:

- Minimal dependencies (no Python required)
- Static linking where possible
- Specific glibc compatibility
- Apple Silicon native support

### Can I use these binaries in a Docker container?

Yes, these binaries are ideal for Docker containers as they have minimal dependencies and will work
on any Linux system with glibc 2.17 or newer.

### How do I request a new package?

Open an issue on GitHub with the package name, source URL, and any specific build requirements.
